# Legal & Abuse Policy

**Purpose**: Define C2 Concierge's legal framework and abuse handling procedures for provenance verification services.

## Core Legal Position

### Provenance Not Truth
C2 Concierge provides verifiable provenance of content; it does not assert truth, accuracy, or endorsement. Our service:

- **Verifies**: The authenticity and integrity of provenance claims
- **Does not verify**: The factual accuracy of content or claims
- **Provides**: Technical verification of cryptographic signatures
- **Does not provide**: Fact-checking, content moderation, or editorial oversight

### Service Scope
We operate as a technical infrastructure layer that:
- Enables content creators to attach verifiable provenance to their work
- Provides cryptographic verification of provenance data
- Maintains immutable records of provenance assertions
- Offers tools for content consumers to validate provenance claims

Any attempt to use C2 Concierge for misleading purposes is strictly prohibited:

- **False Attribution**: Claiming authorship of content you did not create
- **Manipulated Provenance**: Altering or fabricating provenance data to deceive

- **Disinformation Campaigns**: Coordinated efforts to spread false information with verified provenance
- **Fraud**: Financial scams using verified provenance to appear legitimate
- **Harassment**: Using provenance to target or harass individuals
